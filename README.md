# ANZ-Program
Analyse a Packet Capture file using an open source tool to identify and investigate any potential threats
Task 1: If you identify malicious content within the emails, you will need to write a brief report detailing why it is malicious.
Task 2: Suspicious network activity has been detected coming from a user on the ANZ network. 

A laptop has been flagged up on our security systems due to suspicious internet traffic, and we need you to investigate the network traffic in order to establish what the user accessed and downloaded.

Your task is to examine their network activity and gather what information you can on what images they viewed and what files they accessed. 

You have been provided with a packet capture file (pcap) containing all their recent network activity. There may be a number of artifacts contained within the packet capture file, and you will be expected to identify and report as many as possible. 

You must provide a report on everything you found, and document what processes / steps you followed to achieve this.
